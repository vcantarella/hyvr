    "## What is a geobody\n",
    "\n",
    "From Bennet et al. (2019): \"Architectural elements (Miall 1985) are threedimensional sedimentary features (e.g., channels) that are formed by autocyclic processes that occur within depositional systems (Beerbower 1964). They are often superimposed on allocyclic sequences by higher-frequency events that occur over periods of tens to thousands of years (Miall 2013). Different fluvial systems will have their own characteristic architectural elements, and these may range from 101 to 102 m in lateral extent (Miall 1985). Architectural elements are recognized by their outer bounding surfaces, which are often erosional, as well as by their internal facies assemblages (Allen 1983).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These architectural elements can be simplified as geobodies, which are 3D geometries that represent some architectural element. Currently, HyVR implements 3 different geobodies."
