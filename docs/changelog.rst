HyVR 0.1.0b
----------

Release Date 25th January 2024
HyVR has been left untouched for 4 years. This is a fork from the original package.
The idea is to keep a minimal implementation which is built from standard scientific packages with easy installation and
good stability. They are numpy, scipy and numba.

The implementation is tested and works fine. but bugs and unexpected behaviour may be found.
The original workflow has been simplified. Only functions that create the geobodies and assign values to grid are implemented.
On the other hand, the user must know a bit more python and how to generate object based sedimentological simulations.

HyVR 0.9.9
----------

Release Date: 30 November 2018

Changes
"""""""
This release introduces major changes to how HyVR works behind the scenes.
This is a pre-release of the coming version 1.0.0. This will only be published
on github, since the channel generation code is not yet ported to the new
version. Version 1.0.0 will also contain a reimplementation of the channel
generation code and will also be published on PyPI.

These are the most important changes:

* Object oriented code: HyVR is now heavily object oriented. This will hopefully
  make it easier to add new geometries to HyVR, and will enable us to introduce
  features like contact surface conditioning in future versions.
* Better separation of grid and model: A HyVR model is now almost fully
  independent from the grid on which it should be evaluated. Instead of directly
  mapping objects onto the grid at the time of object creation, the model is
  first constructed as list of strata, which again hold lists to their
  architectural elements.
  Only after the full model is created we go over all grid points, decide to
  which object the point belongs, and assign values accordingly.
  This comes with some performance loss due to python slowness. We'll try to
  alleviate these in future releases.
* Changes to ``.ini``-file: Some changes have been made to the parameter file.
  These were partly necessary, e.g. the new contact models, and are partly only
  cosmetic changes to get more verbose option names (e.g. ``strata`` instead of
  ``ssm``, ``ae_in_strata`` instead of ``ssm_ae``, etc.).
  Old-format ini-files will probably still work, but support for them will be
  dropped soon, so we urge all users to make the necessary changes to their
  ini-files. (It's really not that much work.)
* **No channels**: This version does not yet support channels. This will be part
  of version 1.0.0.
