This project is a fork of the original HyVR package, aiming to preserve its core ideas while ensuring maintainability within the modern Python ecosystem.

The Hydrogeological Virtual Reality (HyVR) simulation package is a Python module that helps researchers and practitioners generate sedimentary subsurface models. These models feature multiple scales of heterogeneity based on geological concepts and can be used to explore groundwater flow and solute transport. HyVR works with a pre-existing regular grid, which can be used directly in MODFLOW or interpolated to a different simulation grid.

The original motivation for HyVR was the need for tools to model sedimentary deposits that include bedding structure information (i.e., dip and azimuth). These parameters are essential for approximating full hydraulic-conductivity tensors for groundwater flow modeling. HyVR can simulate these bedding parameters and generate spatially distributed parameter fields, including full hydraulic-conductivity tensors.

For more information, the original HyVR documentation is available online in the [technical documentation](https://driftingtides.github.io/hyvr/index.html).
