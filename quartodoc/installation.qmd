## Installing the HyVR package

The package is designed to work in a Conda or other virtual environment. Before installation, ensure your environment has up-to-date versions of the following libraries:

- numpy
- numba
- scipy

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install HyVR using `pip`. First, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate into the project's root directory, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```
