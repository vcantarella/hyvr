    "## Modelling Sedimentary Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "We base the framework on the original work from Bennett et al (2018), which has written the first version of HyVR. The framework is hierarchical, meaning that structures can be organized in different scales depending on the context, but that they may represent complex sedimentary archictectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis of the facies present in the tufa we came up with an achitecture formed by the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tufa is likely transported from upstream. Seepage from supersaturated groundwater from the carbonate formation intersects the ammer river upstream and probably caused the precipitation of tufa particles in association with adequate flora in a wetland-like environment. Then river water would carry this sediment downstream along with organic matter (often preserved as plant remains), and deposit this material in the Ammer floodplain. We see different facies with varying amounts of tufa and organic matter, and varying composition of organic matter. Likely the system stabilized for periods of time, giving structure to different local wetland environments. Depending on the stability and preservation characteristics peat lenses would form, and the river channel shape would be preserved as gravel deposits. During sediment inflow periods, continuous input of sedimentation would make the river shape unstable, meaning it would not preserve its shape. The wetland environments would then receive tufa sedimentation and deposit mixes of tufa clasts and phytoclasts and organic matter. We think of this period as a succession of discontinuous lenses which are elongated in the direction of flow of different facies associated with different local wetland environments reworked by transport and deposition of external tufa particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can think of the system as an aggradational sequence of lenses of different mix composition between tufas and phytoclasts, organic particles, which comprises different facies recorded in the sedimentary analysis. At the end of the sequence we would have the reduction of sedimentary the sedimentary load, leading to a stable configuration where peat lenses would be preserved and the preservation of channel features. Upon the next increase of sedimentary load, the channel features would be preferentially filled with gravel particles, while the peat lenses then would be buried, and the sequence then repeats itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is organized as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the sequence thicknesses (sampled from a distribution)\n",
    "2. Over the thickness t:\n",
    "    2.1. Iterate over each facies f associated with the aggradation period:\n",
    "        2.1.1. generate lens of thickness t at a randomly sampled location and with reasonably chosen dimensions. Assign it to facies f\n",
    "        2.1.2. repeat 2.1 until the proportion of facies f is slightly above the calculated proportion (since one object can erode the previous we use slightly bigger proportion in the algorithm).\n",
    "    2.3. Generate lens of thickness t or max_peat_thickness at a randomly sampled location and with reasonably chosen dimension of the facies peat\n",
    "    2.4. repeat 2.3 until proportion of peat is the same as the calculated proportion.\n",
    "    2.5. Generate a channel starting on the left of the grid and on a randomly sampled high y value with thickness t or max_channel_thickness and width $\\approx$ 4 m.\n",
